# Notice

The component and platforms in this repository are not meant to be used by a
user, but as a "blueprint" that custom component developers can build
upon, to make more awesome stuff.

HAVE FUN! ðŸ˜Ž

## Why?

This is simple, by having custom_components look (README + structure) the same
it is easier for developers to help each other and for users to start using them.

If you are a developer and you want to add things to this "blueprint" that you think more
developers will have use for, please open a PR to add it :)

`LICENSE.md` | The license file for the project.
`README.md` | The file you are reading now, should contain info about the integration, installation and configuration instructions.
`requirements.txt` | Python packages used by this integration.
`requirements-dev.txt` | Python packages used to provide [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)/code hints during development of this integration, typically includes packages in `requirements.txt` but may include additional packages
`requirements-text.txt` | Python packages required to run the tests for this integration, typically includes packages in `requirements-dev.txt` but may include additional packages

## How?

If you want to use all the potential and features of this blueprint template you
should use Visual Studio Code to develop in a container. In this container you
will have all the tools to ease your python development and a dedicated Home
Assistant core instance to run your integration. See `.devcontainer/README.md` for more information.

If you need to work on the python library in parallel of this integration
(`sampleclient` in this example) there are different options. The following one seems
easy to implement:

- Create a dedicated branch for your python library on a public git repository (example: branch
`dev` on `https://github.com/ludeeus/sampleclient`)
- Update in the `manifest.json` file the `requirements` key to point on your development branch
( example: `"requirements": ["git+https://github.com/ludeeus/sampleclient.git@dev#devp==0.0.1beta1"]`)
- Each time you need to make a modification to your python library, push it to your
development branch and increase the number of the python library version in `manifest.json` file
to ensure Home Assistant update the code of the python library. (example `"requirements": ["git+https://...==0.0.1beta2"]`).

1. Click Install below the found integration.
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Blueprint".

### Manual installation

1. Configure integration via Home Assistant GUI or via your `configuration.yaml` file using the configuration instructions below.
1. Restart Home Assistant

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `integration_blueprint`.
1. Download file `integration_blueprint.zip` from the [latest release section][releases-latest] in this repository.
1. Extract _all_ files from this archive you downloaded in the directory (folder) you created.
